
What is luster
Lustre is a type of parallel distributed 
file system, generally used for large-scale cluster computing

LNet

Lustre Networking, or LNET, which provides the communication
infrastructure required by the Lustre filesystem

LNET supports many commonly used network types, 
which include InfiniBand and IP
networks.

stored in /etc/modprobe.conf, but this has been deprecated since
before RHEL5 and SLES10

MDS:MDT 
 Storage types that provide much lower seek times, such as SSD or NVMe is strongly
preferred for the MDT

To configure a simple Lustre file system, complete these steps:
Configuring a Lustre File System
73
1. Create a combined MGS/MDT file system on a block device. On the MDS node, run:
mkfs.lustre --fsname=
fsname --mgs --mdt --index=0
/dev/block_device
The default file system name ( fsname) is lustre.
Note
If you plan to create multiple file systems, the MGS should be created separately on its own
dedicated block device, by running:
mkfs.lustre --fsname=
fsname --mgs
/dev/block_device
See Section 13.8, “ Running Multiple Lustre File Systems”for more details.
2. Optional for Lustre software release 2.4 and later. Add in additional MDTs.
mkfs.lustre --fsname=
fsname --mgsnode=
nid --mdt --index=1
/dev/block_device
Note
Up to 4095 additional MDTs can be added.
3. Mount the combined MGS/MDT file system on the block device. On the MDS node, run:
mount -t lustre
/dev/block_device
/mount_point
Note
If you have created an MGS and an MDT on separate block devices, mount them both.
4. Create the OST. On the OSS node, run:
mkfs.lustre --fsname=
fsname --mgsnode=
MGS_NID --ost --index=
OST_index
/dev/block_device
When you create an OST, you are formatting a ldiskfs or ZFS file system on a block storage device
like you would with any local file system.
Configuring a Lustre File System
74
You can have as many OSTs per OSS as the hardware or drivers allow. For more information about
storage and memory requirements for a Lustre file system, see Chapter 5, Determining Hardware
Configuration Requirements and Formatting Options
